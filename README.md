# Predicting-Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Using-Machine-Learning

## Project Description:
This project presents a data-driven analysis of hospital length of stay (LOS) using supervised machine learning techniques applied to large-scale inpatient healthcare data. By integrating clinical severity indicators, discharge characteristics, demographic attributes, and payer information, we examine how patient-level and system-level factors jointly influence hospital utilization and operational efficiency.

The analysis evaluates multiple regression-based models, including linear regression, decision trees, and gradient-boosted ensembles, to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships in LOS patterns. Through exploratory data analysis, feature importance assessment, and model comparison, the project identifies key drivers of prolonged stays—particularly clinical acuity, discharge disposition, and payer mix—while highlighting limitations introduced by skewed LOS distributions.

A stacked modeling approach is used to improve predictive stability and accuracy, demonstrating how ensemble methods can enhance decision support for hospital capacity planning, staffing optimization, and cost forecasting. The project concludes by discussing operational implications, model limitations, and opportunities for extending LOS prediction with richer clinical data.
